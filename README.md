# AWS VPN Client

A CLI solution to enable Linux distros to connect to AWS VPN infrastructure with SAML SSO,
heavily based on [an existing solution](https://smallhacks.wordpress.com/2020/07/08/aws-client-vpn-internals/)
([repo](https://github.com/samm-git/aws-vpn-client)).

## Prerequisites

- Linux (of course!).
- `docker` and `docker-compose`.
- A suitable DNS solution for your system. For instance,
  [Arch Linux mentioned a custom script maintained by OpenVPN](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/OpenVPN#DNS).
  This should be updated to `ovpn.conf` file.

## Configuration

This solution requires a modified version of OpenVPN client.

### Make the binaries

To obtain both the CLI and the patched OpenVPN client, run:

```shell
$ OPENVPN_VERSION=<latest_supported_version> docker compose up make
```

List of `<latest_supported_version>`'s is available at `/patches` folder.

Then in `./build` folder there should be 3 binaries:

- `openvpn-musl` for musl libc platforms.
- `openvpn-glibc` for glibc platforms.
- `aws-vpn-client`.

The dockerfile are using just the latest versions of base images and packages. They are meant for one time openvpn creation and not for production so it's easier to revolve package issues with latest versions for me

### Patch a new OpenVPN version

To generate a patch for a newer OpenVPN version, use the current latest as base:

```shell
$ FROM_VERSION=<current_latest> TO_VERSION=<upstream_latest> docker compose up gen-patch
```

The `<upstream_latest>` version can be found at [OpenVPN GitHub tags](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/tags).
If you're using Arch Linux, remember also to update the new version in `archlinux/PKGBUILD` and run `updpkgsums`

### OpenVPN config file

Make sure you have:

* `auth-retry interact` option removed.
* `auth-federate` option removed (custom AWS option not supported by openvpn).
* (Optionally) `inactive 3600` option added.
* `script-security 2` option added for allowing up and down scripts

## Authenticate and connect to the VPN

Run:

```shell
$ ./connect.sh
  --cmd ./build/aws-vpn-client \          # optional, default to './build/aws-vpn-client'
  --ovpn ./build/openvpn-<variant> \      # optional, default to './build/openvpn-glibc'
  --config /path/to/openvpn.conf \        # optional, default to './build/ovpn.conf'
  --up /path/to/client-up-script \        # optional, default to './connect/vpn-client.up'
  --down /path/to/client-down-script      # optional, default to './connect/vpn-client.down'
```

where `<variant>` could be either `musl` or `glibc`

For all the supported flags, consult [Options for aws-vpn-client](#options-for-aws-vpn-client).

By default (with `-on-challenge=listen`), a URL will be automatically opened in your default browser.
Do all the necessary authentication steps and you should finally get
`Authentication details received, processing details. You may close this window at any time.`

You'll be successfully connected once you get something like this:

```
...
[timestamp] Successfully connected
```

with `-verbose` flag provided, you might get something like this:

```
...
[timestamp] net_route_v4_add: <ip> via <ip> dev [NULL] table 0 metric -1
[timestamp] Initialization Sequence Completed
[timestamp] Successfully connected
```

otherwise, it's failed if you get:

```
[timestamp] Connection rejected, please re-run to try again
```

## Under the hood

The `aws-vpn-client` CLI runs in 3 phases:

1. Running without root access, expecting failure to get a response like this

    ```
    SENT CONTROL [your.server.domain]: 'PUSH_REQUEST' (status=1)
    AUTH: Received control message: AUTH_FAILED,CRV1:R:instance-1/<some_numeric_id>/<some_uuid>:b'<some_string>':https://your.authentication.server/some-uuid?SAMLRequest=<request_string>
    SIGTERM[soft,auth-failure] received, process exiting
    ```

    Notes that in the `AUTH: received control message: ...` line, we have `CRV1:R:<VPN_SID>:<CHALLENGE_URL>`.

2. Open your default browser to visit the `CHALLENGE_URL`.

3. Running with root access, concatenates the above `VPN_SID` value with
  the retrieved `SAML_RESPONSE` string, feeds it to `--auth-user-pass` param of `openvpn`.

## Options for aws-vpn-client

`aws-vpn-client` accepts these flags:

```
  -ovpn string
    	path to OpenVPN binary (default "./openvpn")
  -config string
    	path to OpenVPN config (default "./ovpn.conf")
  -on-challenge string
    	"auto" (follow and parse challenge URL) or "listen" (spawn a SAML server and wait) (default "listen")
  -verbose
    	print more logs
```

When any flags are absent, the client will lookup for environment variables
before fallback to the default value:

- `AWS_VPN_OVPN_BIN` for `-ovpn`.
- `AWS_VPN_OVPN_CONF` for `-config`.
- `AWS_VPN_ON_CHALLENGE` for `-on-challenge`.
- `AWS_VPN_VERBOSE` for `-verbose`. This accepts `1, t, T, TRUE, true, True` as `true`, otherwise `false`.

# On Arch Linux with `systemd`

Under `arch-linux` folder, there's 2 files that enable Arch Linux users to integrate `aws-vpn-client` with `systemd`:

- `PKGBUILD`: to install `aws-vpn-client` as a `pacman` package.
- `aws-vpn-client.service` to run as a `--user` service.

## Install

If you're using Arch Linux, remember also to update the new version in `archlinux/PKGBUILD` and run `updpkgsums`
Just run `make`, it'll prepare, install & clean-up the build files

## Configuration

- Before running, copy (or symlink) your OpenVPN config file `ovpn.conf` to `/home/$USER/.config/aws-vpn-client/` directory.
  The `connect.sh` script will look for the config file at this location.
- Because OpenVPN needs `sudo` privilege, and it (`sudo`) doesn't work with `--user` systemd service,
  you need to whitelist it in `/etc/sudoers` with something like:
  ```
  <username> ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/lib/aws-vpn-client/openvpn
  ```

## Running

Now you can connect to AWS VPN using:

```shell
$ systemctl --user start aws-vpn-client
```

The service will be auto-reconnecting (with a delay of 1s) whenever the `connect.sh` fails,
e.g. when `openvpn` receives `SIGUSR1` from suspend.
